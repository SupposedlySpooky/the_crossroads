                    I wake up and go leave my room for a piss.<br>
                    The bathroom is completely different than what I'm used to.<br>
                    There is a naked woman by the far wall that has fallen over on the slick tile.<br>
                    She is laughing very loudly.<br>
                    All along the right wall are men in their night clothes using a line of urinals.<br>
                    Their faces are very red.<br>
                    I decide I cannot go and find an exit that isn't the one I came in through.<br>
                    I enter an ornately decorated room with enormous windows.<br>
                    Despite this, it is very sparsely decorated, only with a bench on one wall.<br>
                    <br>
                      I take a seat and am instatly crushed by an extremely large man.<br>
                      He is laughing and I can see the windows from under his form.<br>
                      The space beyond the window warps and becomes a forest.<br>
                      "Do you like the forest?!" he yells at me.<br>
                      "NO"<br>
                      "What about the tundra?"<br>
                      "NO, I HATE IT, I HATE IT"<br>
                      I am incredibly congested and the force of my voice causes a coughing fit.<br>
                      I hack up a wad of phlegm.<br>

                    A gray city expanse is miles beneath me.<br>
                    I stand on black-speckled scrap metal floating in the air.<br>
                    I am running. I can hear a manâ€™s voice.<br>
                    He is confessing his love to a man who has forgotten him.<br>
                    I do not know either man.<br>

                      Distant machines dinging and clanking.<br>
                      Family is somewhere nearby.<br>
                      I am admiring mechanical cows through arcade stalls.<br>
                      Kind of like those fortune teller booths.<br>
                      Some are puppets.<br>
                      My sister comes up to me and tells me how difficult the cows are.<br>
                      She leaves, and my mom starts showing me baby pictures of my sister.<br>
                      Suddenly, she is holding a year-old version of my sister.<br>
                      She hands her to me and I lift her up to show her the cows.<br>
                      She starts petting them.<br>
                      She seems happy.<br>

                      There is a man with a wide-brimmed hat riding a brown horse.<br>
                      I follow him up a hill.<br>
                      At the top there are the stone ruins which he lives.<br>
                      In the middle of a cleared spot is a bright kiddie pool.<br>
                      Inside slosh two mechanical catfish, swimming in circles, following one another.<br>
                      The man tells me that he isn't good at catching fish, so he made his own.<br>

                      Ancient ruins surround me and dry grass springs up between the cobblestone.<br>
                      There are two giant robed statues.<br>
                      I cannot look up at them, though I am straining my neck trying.<br>
                      I move towards them.<br>
                      Suddenly the force upon my head is lifted and my head swings upward.<br>
                      I am immidately jolted awake when I see that both statues have real human eyes.<br>
                      They dart around and look down at me.<br>

                      I'm in a dark neighborhood.<br>
                      Light is scattered by trees obscuring lampposts.<br>
                      There is an old house.<br>
                      In its window,  I see a sickly yellow face. It's eyes are enormous and watery.<br>
                      It's hands are held up to the glass.<br>
                      I see a police officer looking for the creature and I yell and point at it through the glass.<br>
                      The creature does not move, but it's face shifts to one that is unmistakably human.<br>
                      It's eyes are small, but look just as sad.<br>
                      The officer starts towards the house and I feel my leg break, though I have not moved.<br>
                      I scream for help and the officer backs away from the house and towards me.<br>
                      They don't know what to do.<br>
                      I lay on the ground, crying.<br>
                      I look up at the creature who is looking at me, still sad.<br>
                      "Shoot me!" I gasp.<br>
                      The police officer looks scared.<br>
                      "SHOOT ME!"<br>
                      I lunge towards the officer and everything goes black.<br>

                      The first page has an illustration of an obese man and the text is something about fleas.<br>
                      The second page has an illustration of a bandaged finger with flowers atop it. The text is about mending something.<br>
                      The third page is a black infinity symbol.<br>
                      The fourth page is a crude portrait of a man upside-down.<br>
                      I turn the page and my ears start ringing.<br>
                      The sixth page has a black and white photograph of a man with abnormally large bloodshot eyes.<br>

                      I'm walking down a mall with a crowd of people along with my sister and mom.<br>
                      They are discussing how they are going to eat lunch and then go to the water park.<br>
                      I realize I've forgotten my lunch in the car.<br>
                      They tell me to get it while they go to the house quickly.<br>
                      I run to the parking lot by the water park, and remember we rented a car and don't remember what it looks like.<br>
                      I call my mom and she sounds tired.<br>
                      She starts slurring her words and mixes them together until she's speaking complete nonsense.<br>
                      I'm looking around when I see my mom and my sister walking to the water park.<br>
                      I'm still on the phone with my mom, but she doesn't have a phone in her hand.<br>
                      Whoever was on the phone with me was still talking.<br>
                      I sprint to my mom and sister.<br>
                      Still with the phone pressed to my ear, I tell them there is something in our house.<br>
                      We search the whole house and find nothing.<br>
                      Later that day, I am using the toilet.<br>
                      Sitting down, I hear a voice from the water beneath me.<br>
                      "Look at me"<br>
                      I do not.<br>
                      I leave and the issue goes unresolved for weeks.<br>
                      Eventually, my mom cracked and took a peek at whatever was in the toilet.<br>
                      She was gone.<br>

                      I'm being carried into a room at the end of a long hallway.<br>
                      There were three people in the room and I am handed to two of them.<br>
                      I can hear them whispering about apoplexy under their breath.<br>
                      I didn't know what that meant so I asked them, but they didn't tell me.<br>
                      The two people carry me into a new room and I ask them to let me go.<br>
                      They gave me a weird look and I told them I wanted to find a dictionary.<br>
                      They let me look for one.<br>
                      I find a boy in the hall and I ask him if he knows where I can find a dictionary.<br>
                      He said he did and showed me a closet.<br>
                      He pulled out a plant, a stool, a jug, and handed them to me.<br>
                      He told me all of them were dictionaries.<br>
