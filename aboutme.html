                            <div class=answer>A: Generally, I have a bad habit of just doing stuff without ever planning it, but here's the rundown. Keep in mind that I'm starting college soon, so the amount of free time I have is destined to decrease.<br>
In the short term (next few months - start of 2023), I would like to:<br>
* Release the game I'm working on currently<br>
* Make a small multiplayer proof-of-concept game<br>
* Release an album (see below)<br>
In the long term (next year and beyond):<br>
* I'd like to explore some industries that have elements that I already have interest in (game development, illustration, anatomy illustrations(?), etc.) </div>

                            Game soundtracks are a different story though. I already posted the full OST (used and unused) for TGLAD, which is up on YouTube.</div>

                            <div class=question>Q: "What's your story behind becoming an artist/creator?"</div>
                            <div class=answer>A: Started drawing in fourth grade with little alien creatures- made a whole exozoology that was pretty cool. In my freshman year I started an Instagram with ink and pencil doodles. A few years later I started doing found footage. Instagram kind of blew up- I started making games- realized I wasn't being creatively challenged- ditched found footage- got invested in surrealism.</div>

                            <div class=question>Q: "How did you find your own aesthetics? What fascinates you about it, if anything?"</div>
                            <div class=answer>A: Found a lot of my aesthetic through old media- old anatomy textbooks and games.<br>
                            Something I both like and would like to develop about my 'aesthetic', is the feeling you've stumbled upon something that's existed for a long time, but you're only now seeing it.<br> Then again, I feel like sometimes I have to reel myself back in because things have gotten too indecipherable, which isn't ideal.
