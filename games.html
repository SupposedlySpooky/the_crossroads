        <td>my very first game<br>i was first inspired to make games from a video essay by Jacob Geller about Kitty Horrorshow's Haunted Cities V4. the way he talked about taking your agony and realizing it (especially in his description (and beautiful voiceover) of Lethargy Hill) really resonated with me. not that i necessarily had untold anguish to disperse, but taking your emotions and using them in that way was something i was <i>extremely</i> interested in.<br>that being said. Little Eavesdropper is not the emotional barrage i might have hoped for. it is a shit game, but by virtue as a shit indie gamedev, i leave it up because people deserve to know where i started.</td>
