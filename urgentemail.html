        <div class=content>
            <div class=paragraph>To Whom It May Concern,</div>
            <div class=paragraph>Regarding our last correspondence, I took issue with your apparent ambition to make games and the relative inactivity towards that goal on your part. You made it clear you desire to make games, but you 
                <div class="tooltip"><input type="text" id="fname" name="fname"><span class="tooltiptext">insert explanation that does not physically, mentally, or economically bar you from reaching your goal)</span></div></div>
            <div class=paragraph>That’s it? That’s all that’s stopping you? You know you don’t even need to do that to make games right? And even if you did, you could learn. It’s not a lost art, in fact the best time to learn is</div>
            <div class=paragraph><div class = shaker><b>LITERALLY RIGHT NOW</b></div></div>
            <div class=paragraph>Let me be clear.</div>    
            <div class=paragraph><div class = shaker><b>YOU DO NOT HAVE TO BE TALENTED TO MAKE GAMES</b></div></div>
            <div class=paragraph>That is a ridiculous assumption that you have to be good at making games in order to make games. I leave all of my old games up for the specific purpose of showing you that GAMES CAN BE BAD!!! ITS OK IF YOUR GAME IS BAD!!! Talent is not a prerequisite for trying anything.. Ever.</div>  
            <div class=paragraph>You need time and motivation.</div>  
            
            <div class=paragraph>
            With all that said<br>Would you like to make games?
            </div> 
            
            <div class=paragraph>
            <input type="radio" id="rad1" name="same">Yes
                
            <input type="radio" id="rad2" name="same">No
                
            <div class="option1Content" id="option1Content">
                <div class=paragraph>OH WONDEROUS!!!<br>Now where to begin. I believe the best starting place for anything is to simply start experimenting and seeing what you enjoy, so instead of telling you what direct path you should venture down, how about I give you some starting places so you can decide for yourself?</div>
                
                <div class=paragraph2><h3>Game Engines!!</h3>Now, there are a lot of game engines. Like a lot, and all of them have use cases.<br>I am both a cheapskate and an opprotunist, so I typically recommend either Unity or Godot, both of which are completely* free.<br>I started out with Unity and found it very easy to get into, especially with the large amount of tutorials online to get started with. I switched to Godot after Unity made their infamous decicion™ and found it was slightly harder to understand in the beginning, but now I find it much easier to get into.</div>
                
                <div class=paragraph2><h3>Music :D</h3>Bosca Ceoil is how I started making music. It is very intuitive and simple and <i>free</i>, and also has a very nice chippy sound to it I enjoy a lot. Since I recieved a lot of donations from TGLAD's released I decided to spoil myself and buy FL Studio which yes, is very expensive, and I won't recommend it for that reason, but it is what I use nowadays.</div>
                
                <div class=paragraph2><h3>Art :3</h3>I was an artist before a game developer so most of these tools were already available to me. Procreate is a very good IPad drawing app which I enjoy very much, and goes for 13 bucks. Aseprite is a pixel drawing/animation program that I use to animate most of my work and goes for 20 big ones. I used Krita for a short time, and while it is an <i>okay</i> drawing program for being free, I loathed working with it.<br>I guess 3D art and models also fit in here, so I use Blender. Most people know Blender, it's good, it's free, it's kind of difficult to learn but it's not an impossible task and its absolutely worth the struggle.</div>

            <div class="option2Content" id="option2Content">
                <div class=paragraph>THATS LITERALLY FINE.<br>You obviously do not need to desire making games. It can be very draining, or maybe you just don't find the idea appealing. That's fine!<br>I hope you have taken my rant as inspirational rather than argumentative and rude.</div>
