                        <div class=text>The year is 2015, Christmas day. I tear open a rectangular gift and am immidiately baffled by the vision before me. Are they kids... or are they squids?</div>  
                        
                        <div class=text>In reality, I had already seen the promo material some months prior, and was thoroughly unimpressed. This was a kids game, and I was no kid. I was eleven for christs sake.</div>
                        
                        <div class=text>Trying not to be rude, I went downstairs and booted up my WiiU. I don't really remember much of my experience playing the first Splatoon, but I know I was immidiately hooked. I would hum the songs in classes, drew funky squid people in my margins, I was relentless.</div>
                        
                        <div class=text>When Splatoon 2 dropped, I didn't have a switch. I wasn't too cut up about it. Some of my online friends would be playing and I would remain adamant that it was just as good as the first one.<br> It was not as good as the first one.<br>
                        Still though, I got it eventually some other Christmas, and I loved it. Near the end of Splatoon 2's life, just before Splatoon 3 got announced, I started getting <i>really</i> into it.</div>
                        
                        <div class=text>I started playing more ranked, I learned how to sub-strafe, I got absurdly good with chargers, grades tanked, etc.</div>
                        
                        <div class=text>I was watching the February 2021 Direct with some friends and I remember screaming when Splatoon 3 got announced. A year and a half of waiting later and it's out and it's everything I'd hoped for.</div>
                        
                        <div class=text>Retrospectively, I think I was drawn to Splatoon conceptually because I've always been fascinated with that I don't understand. It doesn't get that much harder to understand than a post human-era squid civilization with their own unique culture and language that uses their own fluids to paint the ground. It just so happens that it's also a really fun Nintendo game from 2015 as well.</div>
