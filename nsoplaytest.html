        On October 9th, 2024, Nintendo announced they would be preforming a test, inviting ten thousand players to try the new feature.<br>
            Many assumed it would be testing a Switch 2 feature, or maybe NSO gamecube games.<br>
            This is where <i>I</i> tuned out, having little interest in either.<br>
            Until...<br>

                <source src="images/playtest/parkour.mov" type="video/mp4">
                </video></center><br>
            This was the first clip I saw from the playtest.<br>
            It was a game.<br>
            One that looked relatively complete.<br>

        This is everything I know:<br>
            * It is an MMO<br>
            * It is rumored to be developed by one of Nintendo's internal development teams, <a href="https://nintendo.fandom.com/wiki/Nintendo_EPD_Production_Group_No._4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EPD 4</a><br>
            * It will feature UGC (User Generated Content), and you have to take an in-game exam in order to obtain a UGC Lisence<br>
            * The central gameplay loop is centered around developing a planet with those around you<br><br>
            Okay I lied, I do know more, but wouldn't you rather me SHOW you?<br><br>
            <div class=warning>All clips are provided by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/sky.femboyfurry.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>sky.femboyfurry.net</b></a>, without whom <i>this</i> would not be possible and most of the information we have about this playtest would be lost. I cannot thank them enough.</div>

                <div class = header2>So, what now?</div>
                <p>Well, as vigilant as Nintendo has been about taking down clips from this playtest, I'm not sure how capable they would be at finding this small page with such little traffic.<br>That said, it's possible.<br>Nintendo has actually not been very agressive about this- just taking down videos from twitter, bluesky, youtube, twitch, whatever, but not really slapping people on the wrist.<br>I suppose it's possible they might contact GitHub about removing the music and clips here, but I'm not sure what GitHub's policy on copyright infringement is.</p>
                <p>Anyway, I find it incredibly likely this game will release at some point, likely soon. My personal bet is during the February 2025 direct.<br>In such a case, this page will be updated to have the correct title, as well as my continued impressions of the game. <i>This</i> segment will also remain up, but hidden down at the bottom so we can all point and laugh at me for being wrong when it actually releases February 2026.</p>
                <p>P.S. If Nintendo so much as GRAZES my fan-renders I made as set dressing, they've got another thing coming</p>
